## Follow-up Design Questionnaire

### Data availability
Is it on Fragalysis? What is it’s name?

If not, could you share the PDBs and SMILES via OneDrive?
If you do not have SMILES, do you have anything similar? It is essential to add bond order and fix protonation which is painful otherwise.

Do you have a reference structure?

### Oligomeric cardinality
What is the oligomeric state/cardinality of the protein in vivo and in your crystal?
If biologically a monomer, but packs in as an asymmetric dimer, are any differences between chains?

### Activity
What residues are important? (I can find out…)

What does your protein do? (I can check on Uniprot)

Is the substrate known? If protein but the binding isn’t know, do you need an AF2 model (ColabFold)?

Any PDBs of interest? Should I run my code to steal ligands from homologues?

### Hits
Do you have hits you are very interesting in / confident in that are in the active site?
Do any of the hits alter the protein structure? I.e. the protein is in a conformation like apo vs substrate-bound vs transition-state-bound vs product-bound vs PTM
(Does your protein behave that way and should any modelling be done?)

### Ideas
Do you have any ideas you would like tested for expected pose?
Say linking A and B via an amide.
Compounds scribbled on paper is fine, but you can use the editor in say https://arthor.docking.org/index.html

### Vendors
Are all standard vendors okay? Enamine REAL & co. are the go to, but you might have specific unusual vendors in mind.
Time frame
When is your next visit scheduled?

### Outcome
Can I store the results on GitHub publicly? Privately and I add you?
How much curation of the output is sought?
If a shortlist is sought

* how many?
* How daring? (i.e. “Honestly, the next will be the last visit and no further elaborations will happen, so do go all in” or “I want to better explore binding space for the ultimate drug”)

How much technical information would you like back?

### Other side quests

For a past screen, the idea of a fluorescent probe was raised for example.
