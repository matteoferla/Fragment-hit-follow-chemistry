## Terms used in XChem

In XChem the following non-standard terms are commonly used and are just synonyms for the standard terms:

* `Follow-up`: _derivative compound_ that is made from a hit compound. Can be virtual or a hit
* `inspiration`: _reference hit_ compound that is used to make a follow-up compound
* `Xe`: in the XChem codebase, it is not a xenon atom, but a `*` dummy atom
* THERE IS ANOTHER ONE, BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER IT

## Technologies
* `PanDDA`: the XChem pipeline for analysing datasets
* `Fragalysis`: the XChem web app [https://fragalysis.diamond.ac.uk/](fragalysis.diamond.ac.uk)
* `XChemExplorer`: the XChem GUI
* `XChemDB`: the XChem database
* `CAR` (chemist assisted robotics): XChem's in-house synthesis platform

## Other
Lastly, in some codebases of mine functions or methods named after 
the verb to fragment may be written `fragmént` with an acute accent on the e,
while the noun `fragment` is written `frágment`.
This is becuase of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial-stress-derived_noun.
Marking stress is uncommon beyond grammatical discussion, so is non-standard spelling.
Furthermore, in colab notebooks, unicode variables are not supported.
So this is very much a personal quirk.
