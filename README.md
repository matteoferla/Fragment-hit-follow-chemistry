# Fragment hit follow chemistry collection

> :construction: This repository is under construction :construction:

A collection of notebooks and scripts for the prediction of follow-up compounds 
I used for follow-up chemistry for XChem targets,
_ie._ small fragments identified crystallographically.

It is not intended as an exhaustive repository of all possible methods.

`ZincInformer` in [zinc_data.py](followup/zinc_data.py) is a class to get data from a series of ZINC IDs.
