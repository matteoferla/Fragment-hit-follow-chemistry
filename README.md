# Fragment hit follow chemistry collection

> :construction: This repository is under construction :construction:

A collection of notebooks and scripts for the prediction of follow-up compounds 
I used for follow-up chemistry for XChem targets,
_ie._ small fragments identified crystallographically.

It is not intended as an exhaustive repository of all possible methods.
