# Fragment hit follow chemistry collection

A collection of notebooks and scripts for the prediction of follow-up compounds 
I used for follow-up chemistry for XChem targets,
_ie._ small fragments identified crystallographically.

It is not intended as an exhaustive repository of all possible methods.
For now I am adding my code (:construction:).

Furthermore, this is narrowly focused on the hit discovery stage of drug discovery,
before any activity data can be determined and any that does exist are deep in noise
(so no talk of QSAR, activity cliffs, ADMET etc etc).

For now see: [:octocat:: EV-D68-3C-protease](https://github.com/matteoferla/EV-D68-3C-protease)

For the questionnaire for now target analysis MF uses see [questionnaire.md](questionnaire.md).

## XChem compound libraries

### Dataset generation

[combined XChem libraries](combined-XChem-libraries.csv) is a CSV file of the compounds in the XChem libraries.

The code to generate it is [notebooks/combine_libraries.ipynb](notebooks/combine_libraries.ipynb).

NB. Some compounds are in two or more libraries. Each row is a library entry. See `also_in` column for duplicates.

### Lookup

Given a list of compounds, get its source library. This is not an inchikey lookup as bond order might be wrong.
So silly amount of pain.

```python
from followup.row_getter import RowGetter

library_collection = pd.read_csv('combined-XChem-libraries.csv', index_col=0)
PandasTools.AddMoleculeColumnToFrame(library_collection, 'SMILES', 'molecule', True)
matches: pd.DataFrame = RowGetter(library_collection, 'molecule').get_matching_hits(mols)
```

> :construction: CHECK there are two versions of this script. There is one that returns a single row per hit. This is the other?

### Comparison

A very common discussion point is if this compound was a hit,
what other compounds in the library are similar?

## XChem public targets

In [:octocat:: munged-Fragalysis-targets](https://github.com/matteoferla/munged-Fragalysis-targets)
the Fragalysis targets are explored by Blast to Xref with Uniprot,
yielding a [table of useful information](https://github.com/matteoferla/munged-Fragalysis-targets/blob/main/targets.csv).

NB. Not all data in Fragalysis has the same layout.

NB. The table is not polished by species popularity: a few protein are identical in some close species,
and the wrong one is picked â€”nobody, not even chimpanzees, cares for NUDT4 in chimpanzees.

To get the email address of a researcher involved in a target, asking is the best way.

## Fragment theft

> See [hit-theft notebook](notebooks/hit-theft.ipynb)

Run a Blastp search against PDB entries in NCBI to find homologues and then steal their ligands,
by aligning in PyMOL against a reference structure.

Code originally adapted from
[colab-pyrosetta-migrate_ligands.ipynb](https://github.com/matteoferla/pyrosetta-help/blob/main/colab_notebooks/colab-pyrosetta-migrate_ligands.ipynb)
(modded to use PyMOL over PyRosetta).

## Fragment extraction

**Any script here present is for fragment cleanup is not the official Fragalysis way.**

But briefly, the problem is as follows:

* A compound may be racemic but only one isomer binds. It will be split later on.
* A unique compound may bind more than once. It will have a single XChem code.
* A PDB structure may be a dimer in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, but a monomer in vivo. A compound may bind in both or in a single chain. Each chain will have a different PDB.
* A compound may have ambiguous conformers (think glutamine and histidine orientations), the PDBs will have partial density and alt IDs.

## PLIP

PLIP extract interactions from PDB files.

NB. `intxn` is non-standard and unclear to many, please don't copy.

## Fragalysis

Typical folder format in Fragalysis is:

* smiles.smi â€” optional
* metadata.csv â€” optional
* reference.pdb â€” optional
* extra_files/* â€” optional
* aligned/ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»-ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾/ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾_bound.pdb.pdb

### Fauxalysis

The latter can be replicated with `make_fauxalysis` from [followup.fauxalysis](followup/fauxalysis.py)

The dummy Fragalysis download structure is needed for a few things.

### Fragalysis Download

In [followup.fragalysis_download](followup/fragalysis_download.py) there is a script to download a Fragalysis target.

```python
from followup/fragalysis_download import QuickDownloader
import pandas as pd
from typing import List
print(f'Default settings are: {QuickDownloader.api_data}')

# Check if the target name is right
target_names: List[str] = QuickDownloader.retrieve_target_names()
target_name='Mpro'
assert target_name in target_names, f'Target named "{target_name}" not found in the list of targets'

# Download the data
quick = QuickDownloader(target_name=target_name)
quick.write_all(directory='downloads')
hits: pd.DataFrame = quick.to_pandas(star_dummy=True)

# Not all files have the reference pdb block, so if it does not the template is returned:
reference_pdbblock: str = quick.reference_pdbblock
```

NB. For legacy targets in particular, the zip may be broken.

### Fragalysis Upload

This is just to prep.
The upload form is at https://fragalysis.diamond.ac.uk/viewer/upload_cset/
> :construction: The upload code exists in Fragalysis-API old version. Hunt it down.

```python
from followup.prep_fragalysis import prep, generate_header
header = generate_header(method='Foo',
                         ref_url='https://www.example.com',
                         submitter_name='unknown',
                         submitter_email='a@b.c',
                         submitter_institution='Nowehere',
                         generation_date='2012-12-12',
                         smiles='CN1C=NC2=C1C(=O)N(C(=O)N2C)C',
                         extras={'âˆ†âˆ†G': 'W. Josiah Gibbs'})
prep(df, header, 'mol', 'id', 'foo.sdf', 'x1234', 'x1234', ['âˆ†âˆ†G'])
```

## OE ROCS

This task has three parts:

1. Subsetting of Enamine BB, see below.
2. Conformer generation with OE Omega.
3. FastROCS with the conformers, or OE ROCS GUI derp around.

In [:octocat:: Functional-subsets-of-Enamine-BB](https://github.com/matteoferla/Functional-subsets-of-Enamine-BB)
Enamine BB is split into functional subsets.
Due to size, the OE Omega conformers are not included.

### Zinc data

`ZincInformer` in [zinc_data.py](followup/zinc_data.py) is a class to get data from a series of ZINC IDs.

### Enamine REAL DB download

The download of the Enamine REAL DB was done using [this script](https://gist.github.com/matteoferla/b1eee8656079d006835f2d8dc159fbb5)
requires registration.
The other databases in OPIG bitbucket are from different sources: see README.md files therein!
